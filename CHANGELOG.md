## [v1.0.0 - Simulation Engine Release](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 15 Dec 2023

After 4 years of Alpha and Beta stages, the project is stable and performant enough to finally be released as version 1.0 and with that, we decided to give it a new name:

## brs-engine - BrightScript Simulation Engine

The term _simulation engine_ was chosen instead of the former _emulator_ to better represent the nature and purpose of the project, as there is no intention to fully emulate a Roku device (OS and Hardware), but rather simulate the behavior, as a development tool and as an engine/framework to run BrightScript apps in different platforms.

In this release the [new CLI](/docs/run-as-cli.md) was introduced, still with some limitations (e.g. no `OffScreenCanvas` support), but allowing basic BrightScript code to be executed, either via REPL or files. It also performs the encryption of a `.zip` file into a `.bpk` package to protect the source code.

#### Release Changes

* Renamed package for `brs-engine`
* Renamed libraries to `brs.api.js` and `brs.worker.js`
* Reorganized `src` folder by library, subfolders: `api`, `cli` and `worker`

* Added support optional chaining operators: `?.`, `?(`, `?[`, and `.@` ([#176](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/176))
* Moved `models` list to API library and updated `serialNumber` format
* Added new API event `registry`
* Added check for `break` debug command during the `roMessagePort` loop

* Fixed multiple cascading calls for dot-chained methods ([#55](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/55))
* Fixed `roRegion` offset not being properly applied when `setWrap` was `true` ([#194](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/194))
* Fixed `Val()` function not compliant with Roku ([#162](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/162))
* Fixed duplication of exception handling messages ([#126](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/126))
* Fixed code smells and bugs based on Sonar Cloud recommendations ([#169](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/169))
* Replaced `luxon` by `day.js` on `roDateTime` and `roTimespan` ([#193](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/193))
