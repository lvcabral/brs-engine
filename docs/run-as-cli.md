# Run as Command Line Interface

Once you have built the CLI library you can link it to your path with the following command:

```shell
$ npm link
```

## Usage

This repo provides the `brs-cli` executable, which operates as a REPL, running source files or creating encrypted app packages.
For a list of options run:

```shell
$ brs-cli --help
```

### REPL

An interactive BrightScript REPL (Read-Execute-Print Loop) is available by running `brs-cli` with no arguments, e.g.:

```shell
$ brs-cli

BrightScript Simulation Engine CLI [v1.0.0]

type `help` to see the list of valid REPL commands.

brs> ? "Dennis Ritchie said ""Hello, World!"""
Dennis Ritchie said "Hello, World!"
```

Quit by pressing `^D` (Control-D) or executing `exit`.

## Setting the Color Level

By default the CLI will display text in ANSI Truecolor mode (level 3 below), but you can change it for the session by running:

```shell
$ brs-cli --color 0
```

| Level | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `0` | All colors disabled |
| `1` | Basic color support (16 colors) |
| `2` | 256 color support |
| `3` | Truecolor support (16 million colors) |



### Executing files

The CLI can execute an arbitrary list of BrightScript files (`.brs`) as well!  Simply pass the file(s) to the `brs-cli` executable, e.g.:

```shell
$ cat hello-world.brs
? "Dennis Ritchie said ""Hello, World!"""

$ brs hello-world.brs
Dennis Ritchie said "Hello, World!"
```

It is also possible to run a full BrightScript application `.zip` or `.bpk` file, however it does not support Draw2D objects yet, so only pure BrigtScript code. e.g:

```shell
$ brs-cli ../tests/test-sandbox.zip
```

### Creating an encrypted App package file

If you want to protect your BrightScript application source code, you can create an encrypted package using the CLI, using the parameters:

1. `-p, --pack <password>`:  The password to generate the encrypted package (32 characters long). (default: "")
2. `-o, --out <directory>`:  The directory to save the encrypted package file. (default: "./")

If no password is provided the app will be executed and no encryption happens, below an example of how to encrypt a package:

```shell
$ brs-cli ../tests/test-sandbox.zip --pack b4bf93d0d5e547ca8edcc0f39c6bcc16 --out ./release

BrightScript Simulation Engine CLI [v1.0.0]

Packaging ../tests/test-sandbox.zip...

Package file created as ./release/test-sandbox.bpk with 528 KB.
