# Remote Control Simulation

The `brs-engine` simulates the Roku remote control, offering customizable mapping and extendable capabilities. The browser libraries support **Keyboard** and **Game Pad** simulation, with the default mapping detailed in the section below. It is also possible to [customize the control buttons mapping](./customization.md#control-mapping) and [enable multi-key support](./customization.md#app-manifest) using a special `manifest` entry.

If you want to create your own control simulation, such as a touch screen control, you can use the [Engine API](./engine-api.md) methods `sendKeyDown`, `sendKeyUp`, and `sendKeyPress`.

The NodeJS `brs.ecp.js` library supports sending commands via the [Roku ECP API](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/external-control-api.md), which can also be used to simulate remote control for applications [running under the CLI](./run-as-cli.md).
