# BrightScript Emulator API

The emulator library has a programable interface to make it easy to integrate into any web based application.
The only pre-requisites are:

1. Expose a `canvas` object named `display` on the default `document`.
2. Expose a `div` object named `stats` on the default `document` (optional if you want to show the performance statistics).

## Methods

(default is "") | 
|`terminate(reason)`<br>Terminates the current app/source execution | `reason` (string) - The reason for the termination (showed on debug) | 
|`redraw(fullScreen, width?, height?, dpr?)`<br>Request a display redraw (always keeps the aspect ratio based on display mode)| `fullScreen` (boolean) - Flag to inform if the full screen mode is activated<br>`width` (number) - Width of the canvas, if not passed uses `window.innerWidth`<br>`height` (number) - Height of the canvas, if not passed uses `window.innerHeight`<br>`dpr` (number) - Device pixel ration, if not passed uses `window.devicePixelRatio`|
|`getDisplayMode()`<br>Returns the current display mode. ||
|`setDisplayMode(mode)`<br>Configure the display mode. If an app is running will reset the device | `mode` (string) - Supported modes: `"480p"` (SD), `"720p"` (HD) or `"1080p"`(FHD)|
|`getOverscanMode()`<br>Returns the current overscan mode.||
|`setOverscanMode(mode)`<br>Configure the overscan mode. Can show guidelines or actually cut the frame | `mode` (string) - Supported modes: `"disabled"`, `"guidelines"` or `"overscan"`|
|`enableStats(state)`<br>Enable or disable the Performance Stats overlay | `state` (boolean) - If `true` performance statistics will be shown over the display
|`getAudioMute()`<br>Return `true` if the audio is muted ||
|`setAudioMute(mute)`<br>Mute or un-mute the audio during app execution | `mute` (boolean) - If `true` the audio will be muted |
|`setCustomKeys(keysMap)`<br>Send a custom map of keyboard keys to add/remove from the remote control emulation  | `keysMap` (Map) - See `/src/api/control.ts` for the default mappings |
|`sendKeyDown(key)`<br>Send a remote control key down event to the emulator | `key` (string) - One of valid key codes (see [Roku documentation](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/component-functions/onkeyevent.md)) |
|`sendKeyUp(key)`<br>Send a remote control key up event to the emulator| `key` (string) - One of valid key codes (see [Roku documentation](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/component-functions/onkeyevent.md))|
|`sendKeyPress(key, delay?)`<br>Send a remote control key press event to the emulator| `key` (string) - One of valid key codes (see [Roku documentation](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/component-functions/onkeyevent.md)) <br> `delay` (number) - The delay (in milliseconds) between sending Key Up and Key Down (default is 300ms)|
|`debug(command)`<br>Send a debug command to the Micro Debugger| `command` (string) - The Micro Debugger can be enabled sending `break` command, and after that any valid BrightScript expression or [debug commands](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/developer-program/debugging/debugging-channels.md#brightscript-console-port-8085-commands) can be sent. You can use this method on the browser console to debug your app.|
|`getVersion()`<br>Returns the version of the API library ||

## Events

| Event      | Description                                      | Data Type                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
