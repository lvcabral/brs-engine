## The Project

The **BrightScript Simulation Engine** implements an interpreter for the **BrightScript** language, that can be embedded in Web, Electron and Node.js applications, or used as a CLI/REPL standalone tool, allowing [Roku apps](https://developer.roku.com/overview) to be executed in several different non-Roku platforms.

Initially the focus was on the support of **Draw 2D API** components (`roScreen`, `roCompositor`, `roRegion`, etc.) along with the core elements of the **BrightScript** language, allowing a full Roku app execution over an **HTML5 Canvas**, but the scope was extended to include simulation of the **Roku** file system, registry, remote control and the Micro Debugger.

The **brs-engine** is developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and bundled as a collection of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) JavaScript libraries. Since version 1.9.0 the repository was organized as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains two separate packages, each optimized for different use cases.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The **SceneGraph** support is currently being developed under [a new branch](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/tree/scenegraph), and released as alpha preview. We have a lot of challenges ahead, feel free to reach out and learn how [you can help](docs/contributing.md).
> - Although **brs-engine** runs apps with user interface, it has no intention of emulating the full **Roku OS** or hardware devices, it is primarily aimed as a development tool for the **Roku Community**.
> - The **simulation engine** can also to be used as a framework for running **BrightScript** apps and games in other platforms, like iOS, macOS, Android, Linux and Windows.
> - Please check the [Current Limitations](docs/limitations.md) document for further details on what is still missing or out of scope.
> - This repository was originally a fork from [**brs**](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brs), a **BrightScript** _command line interpreter_.

## üì¶ Browser Platforms Package

<p align="center"><img alt="Simulator Web and Desktop" title="Simulator Web and Desktop" src="docs/images/screenshots.png?raw=true"/></p>

### For web applications, browser extensions, and Electron apps

The browser package provides a complete BrightScript interpreter that runs directly in browser environments with full support for the BrightScript language up to Roku OS version 15.

- **Client-side execution** - No server required
- **Web Worker** - Interpreter runs in a Web Worker, optimized for browser performance
- **HTML5 Canvas rendering** - Full Draw 2D API support
- **Audio & Video** - Supports media playback via HTML5 Audio and Video elements
- **File System Simulation** - Virtual file system for Roku apps
- **BrightScript Micro Debugger** - Step-through debugging capabilities
- **Input Simulation** - Simulates remote control input for Roku apps both via keyboard and gamepad

### Installation

```bash
npm install brs-engine
```

### For command-line tools, automation, and server-side execution

The Node.js package includes a complete CLI application, ECP and SSDP servers, and the Simulation Engine Node.js library that provides a powerful environment for running BrightScript applications in a server-side context or in test automation workflows.

- **Interactive REPL** - Command-line BrightScript shell
- **File Execution** - Run `.brs`, `.zip`, and `.bpk` files
- **ASCII Rendering** - Simulates `roScreen` output in the terminal
- **ECP Server** - External Control Protocol implementation
- **Package Creation** - Build and encrypt `.bpk` files
- **CI/CD Integration** - Perfect for automated testing

### Installation

```bash
# for global CLI installation
npm install -g brs-node

# for project installation
npm install brs-node
```
